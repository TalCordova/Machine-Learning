# Maching Learning Projects
Python code for machine learning algorithms
In this code i use python packages such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and more  
ML classifiers such as decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbors and more

## Classifications:
1. A person will get a heart attack or not [here](https://github.com/TalCordova/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Tal/pythonProject/mlProjectV2.py)
2. A guest will honor a reservation or not [here](https://github.com/TalCordova/Machine-Learning/blob/main/HotelReservation.ipynb)
